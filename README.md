### Structure of report
- ~~Title and team member names~~
- Team member roles: to be written by each team member. Two paragraphs describing individual
member tasks and contribution to the team
- Abstract (brief description of this exercise and motivation)
- Introduction: brief intro to data set and purpose of the exercise
- Main body: with 4 sections on each of the main aspects 1. (basic statistics such as box plots, 2. more
advanced statistics such as correlations and distributions, 3.multi variable regression forecasting
models, visualisation of results, 4. model performance and discussion of results. Most effort should
be put in the last 2 sections on forecasting and performance of forecasting.
- Conclusions
- Appendixes do not count towards the 7page limit, so if there is no room for something in the main
document you can include it in the appendix.
